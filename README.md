==========
This repository contains material created at the GEMs (Gpu-based hEterogeneous systeMs) research group at Linkoeping University. 

The folder RTAS2014 contains the input files as well as results for some experiments reported in the submitted version of the paper.

The repository also contains the the folder ArianSamos2013. This contains the OpenCL code that was used for the experiments reported in the paper:  General Purpose Computing on Low-Power Embedded GPUs: Has It Come of Age? Arian Maghazeh, Unmesh D. Bordoloi, Petru Eles, Zebo Peng, 13th International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation (SAMOS 2013), Samos, Greece, July 15-18, 2013. This code has been tested on Vivante GC2000, NVIDIA Fermi M2050, NVIDIA Quadro NVS 295. Please comment or uncomment pre-processing directives while changing platforms or switching operating systems. The code is not yet declared to be stable. The code for pattern matching has known issues.
