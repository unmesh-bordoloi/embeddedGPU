==========
This repository contains material created at the GEMs (Gpu-based hEterogeneous systeMs) research group at Linkoeping University. The focus is on low-power GPGPU on mobile and embedded devices.

The repository contains the the folder ArianSamos2013. This contains the OpenCL code that was used for the experiments reported in the paper:  General Purpose Computing on Low-Power Embedded GPUs: Has It Come of Age? Arian Maghazeh, Unmesh D. Bordoloi, Petru Eles, Zebo Peng, 13th International Conference on Embedded Computer Systems: Architectures, Modeling, and Simulation (SAMOS 2013), Samos, Greece, July 15-18, 2013. This code has been tested on Vivante GC2000, NVIDIA Fermi M2050, NVIDIA Quadro NVS 295. Please comment or uncomment pre-processing directives while changing platforms or switching operating systems. The code is not yet declared to be stable. The code for pattern matching has known issues.
